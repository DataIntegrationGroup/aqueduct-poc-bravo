  - Fetches from CABQ CKAN API (incrementally, cursor-based)
  - Writes raw parquet to GCS under gs://<bucket>/raw/cabq/cabq_readings/
  - dlt handles incremental cursor, parquet serialisation, GCS write,
    and cursor state persistence alongside the data in GCS

This is the FIRST asset in the CABQ pipeline. No upstream dependencies.

    Runs the dlt pipeline to incrementally fetch CABQ readings and

    dlt handles:
      - API authentication
      - Incremental cursor (only fetches new data since last run)
      - Parquet serialisation
      - GCS write
      - Cursor state persistence (stored in GCS next to the data)

    On subsequent runs: fetches only records newer than the last cursor value.
