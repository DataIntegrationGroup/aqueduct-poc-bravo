"""
canonical_model.py
Defines the SensorThings canonical data model for Aqueduct.

These dataclasses are the contract between source adapters and the FROST loader.
- Adapters produce these shapes
- frost_loader.py consumes these shapes
- Neither knows about the other's internals

Rules every adapter must follow:
  - external_key must be stable and globally unique across runs (used for upsert)
  - All timestamps must be UTC
  - Elevation always in metres
  - Use constants from canonical_constants.py for units, sensors, observed properties
